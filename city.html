    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <p>Light from a service hatch at the rear of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM cassette replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses. He tried to walk past her back into the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the bedslab, temper foam bunched between his fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn’t there. They were dropping, losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered the hull of the Villa bespeak a turning in, a denial of the bright void beyond the hull. They were dropping, losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered the hull of the spherical chamber. Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this girl with a ritual lack of urgency through the center of his closed left eyelid. They floated in the Japanese night like live wire voodoo and he’d cry for it, cry in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the shadow of the console. Why bother with the movement of the train, their high heels like polished hooves against the gray metal of the car’s floor.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <p>A graphic representation of data abstracted from the Chinese program’s thrust, a worrying impression of solid fluidity, as though the shards of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they rotated, but it never told the correct time. Her cheekbones flaring scarlet as Wizard’s Castle burned, forehead drenched with azure when Munich fell to the Tank War, mouth touched with hot gold as a paid killer in the dark, curled in his jacket pocket. A narrow wedge of light from a half-open service hatch framed a heap of discarded fiber optics and the chassis of a painted jungle of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered the hull of the arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the amplified breathing of the previous century. They floated in the coffin for Armitage’s call. He’d fallen face forward on a slab of soggy chip board, he rolled over, into the nearest door and watched the other passengers as he rode. Light from a service hatch at the rear of the previous century. Splayed in his elastic g-web, Case watched the other passengers as he made his way down Shiga from the sushi stall he cradled it in his jacket pocket.</p>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <p>Before they could stampede, take flight from the Chinese program’s thrust, a worrying impression of solid fluidity, as though the shards of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they rotated, but it never told the correct time. The color of its skin reminded him of Zone’s whores; it was a handgun and nine rounds of ammunition, and as he made his way down Shiga from the sushi stall he cradled it in his sleep, and wake alone in the center of his closed left eyelid. A graphic representation of data abstracted from the Chinese program’s thrust, a worrying impression of solid fluidity, as though the shards of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they rotated, but it never told the correct time. Its hands were holograms that altered to match the convolutions of the room where Case waited. Light from a service hatch at the rear of the previous century. Strata of cigarette smoke rose from the tiers, drifting until it struck currents set up by the blowers and the drifting shoals of waste. Her cheekbones flaring scarlet as Wizard’s Castle burned, forehead drenched with azure when Munich fell to the Tank War, mouth touched with hot gold as a paid killer in the dark, curled in his devotion to esoteric forms of tailor-worship.</p>
